Storm
=====

Storm is the control application behind the Yocto Project blimp demo. 

Storm currently has the following capabilities:
  - Remote control over IP
  - Live video capture and streaming over IP
  - Autopilot

Dependencies
------------

This project depends on GTK and gstreamer, each with their respective
python bindings.
The server component is designed to work with Gumstix's Robovero 
expansion board. Communication with the board is facilitated through
use of their python library, available here 
(https://github.com/robovero/python).


DSP Considerations
------------------

In order to get live video encoding working at a reasonable frame rate, it 
is necessary to leverage the on-board digital signal processor (DSP).
Getting this setup is somewhat involved; you will be required to install
some specialized libraries and set aside some physical memory to avoid
conflicts between the DSP and kernel. After everything is in place you 
will be able to plug a DSP accelerated encoder directly into a gstreamer 
pipeline.
